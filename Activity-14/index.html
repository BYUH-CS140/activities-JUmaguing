                <p>
                    The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the gray wolf.
                    Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during
                    the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by
                    humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long
                    association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
                    inadequate for other canids.
                    Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds
                    vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the
                    tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and
                    sight. Compared to humans, dogs possess a superior sense of smell and hearing, but inferior visual
                    acuity. Dogs perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection,
                    companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and assisting police and the military.

                <p>Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including
                    movements of bodies and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They
                    mark their territories by urinating on them, which is more likely when entering a new environment.
                    Over the millennia, dogs have uniquely adapted to human behavior; this adaptation includes being
                    able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human–canine bond has been a topic of
                    frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best
                    friend".
                    The global dog population is estimated at 700 million to 1 billion, distributed around the world.
                    The dog is the most popular pet in the United States, present in 34–40% of households. Developed
                    countries make up approximately 20% of the global dog population, while around 75% of dogs are
                    estimated to be from developing countries, mainly in the form of feral and community dogs.</p>

            <p>The Pug is a breed of dog with the physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and
                curled tail. An ancient breed, with roots dating back to 400 B.C.,[2] they have a fine, glossy coat that
                comes in a variety of colors, most often fawn (light brown) or black, and a compact, square body with
                well developed and thick muscles all over the body.
                Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe
                by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.[3] In the United Kingdom, in the
                nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for Pugs which she passed on to other members of
                the royal family.
                Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.[4] The American Kennel Club describes the
                breed's personality as "even-tempered and charming".[5] Pugs remain popular into the twenty-first
                century, with some famous celebrity owners. The dogs are susceptible to various health problems due to
                their bred traits.[6]</p>
